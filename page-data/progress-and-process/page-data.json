The illusions of grandeur. </p>\n<p>It’s not an easy thing to get right. That’s because it’s not easy to take into account the context, feelings, experiences of someone that isn’t me. I never want to downplay another human’s issues. </p>\n<p>Yet with writing on self-help, you inevitably run the risk of doing just that. </p>\n<h5>OK, now watch me do the things I hate. With passion.

It was planned some months ago, and I had been rigorously training for it ever since. </p>\n<p>It was supposed to be cathartic; a celebration of the many hours of hard work (and the subsequent progress) I had been doing since the summer of 2020. I had visualized myself crossing the finish line countless times. </p>\n<p>Start slow, </p>\n<p> dose your energy during the first 10K, </p>\n<p> eat half a banana on 12.5K, </p>\n<p> pick up the pace, </p>\n<p> hydrate,</p>\n<p>  finish strong,</p>\n<p>maybe cry a petite tear of pride &#x26; joy. </p>\n<p>On March 9th, I ran 15K at a 5:24/K pace.\nOn March 12th, I got sick. Nothing serious, just sick.\nYou know, that virus thing people have been yapping about on TV non stop.\n On March 21st, I ran 0K. </p>\n<p>Sure, I was disappointed, still am. But I realized one very crucial thing:\n My disappointment had little do with the cancelled half marathon. I was more frustrated with the fact that I could not run for about 11 days. </p>\n<p>I ran today. Not a single time did I think about that half marathon. I was just excited to be out running again, even though I can’t for the life of do 15K at a 5:24/K pace right now. </p>\n<h3>In other words: not the <em>progress</em>, but the <em>process</em> means the most to me. I’m no poet, but there is a metaphor to be made here.</h3>\n<p>Does that mean that I don’t see the added value of setting goals, striving for something? No. That’s why I wanted to run a half marathon in the first place. </p>\n<p>However, what would have happened if I did run it? Slow start, banana, strong finish, petite tear of pride &#x26; joy, the whole shebang. </p>\n<p>And then what? Progress made, goal achieved, stop running? No way.  I would have been back at the park, kicking life in the teeth. </p>\n<p> It’s not these grand milestones that define me, that define all of us. </p>\n<p>It’s what happens in between. The training, the good days, the shit days, the rest, the thinking, the doubting, the reassuring, the giving up and calling it a day, the starting back up again.</p>\n<h3>The work is the goal. The process is the progress. We should treat these words like the interchangeable forces they are.</h3>\n<p>I would happily train all my life for a race that will never happen. Because if I have trained the right way, and the big day rolls around, I will have arrived at the point where I am at peace with anything. </p>\n<p>That means I may still get disappointed, things may still hurt me. But it also means that I know that the process of getting here was worth more than the actual crossing of the finish line.</p>\n<h3>OK, I’m going to throw up now.</h3>\n<h6>Oh and by the way, I wrote this blog in part as a reminder to myself. This is the way I <em>want</em> to look at my life. But I am not enlightened or anything.</h6>\n<h6>I got it right this time, with the running and the covid and shit. But I get it wrong in other aspect of my life all the time. Oh well, all part of the process I guess.</h6>","frontmatter":{"title":"On progress and process","date":"March 23, 2021","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/progress-and-process/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/why-ethnography-matters/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On why organizational ethnography matters (to me)"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
