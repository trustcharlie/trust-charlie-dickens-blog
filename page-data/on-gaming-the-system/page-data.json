Upon watching it, two thoughts prevailed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“Oh man, this is baaaaad. I kind of knew social media was toxic but now I’m going to have to delete everything!” </li>\n<li>“This is just the tip of the iceberg. People with a <em>real</em> understanding of algorithms, their design to up my screen time and increase the value of ad slots must be thinking: ‘we told you so Charlie, you’re just now getting in on this?’” </li>\n</ol>\n<p>This temporary episode of anxiety made me feel part of the sheeple.\nNot a great feeling. </p>\n<p>Highly uninformed and highly impressionable, I imagined myself the target victim of big tech corporations’ dopamine-driven feedback loops &#x26; rabbit holes. All I was to them was just another cow to milk. </p>\n<p>And I thought I was special!</p>\n<p><em>Again, full disclosure: I probably am just that - another cow to milk.</em> The Social Dilemma <em>did not diminish my daily social media intake (big whoop: I did not in fact delete everything, did you?).</em></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/6c8be9502e9e6db70e7404ed76d7c153/ec605/zark.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 104.72972972972974%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"a picture of zark\"\n        title=\"a picture of zark\"\n        src=\"/static/6c8be9502e9e6db70e7404ed76d7c153/1c72d/zark.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6c8be9502e9e6db70e7404ed76d7c153/a80bd/zark.jpg 148w,\n/static/6c8be9502e9e6db70e7404ed76d7c153/1c91a/zark.jpg 295w,\n/static/6c8be9502e9e6db70e7404ed76d7c153/1c72d/zark.jpg 590w,\n/static/6c8be9502e9e6db70e7404ed76d7c153/a8a14/zark.jpg 885w,\n/static/6c8be9502e9e6db70e7404ed76d7c153/ec605/zark.jpg 1125w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>However, the unadulterated teenage soap opera on the ‘flix had me asking myself some long overdue questions:\n How do I engage with algorithms? </p>\n<p>How much influence do they have on my life?</p>\n<p>How do they inform my decision making? </p>\n<p>Was it all just a dream?!</p>\n<p>Once that medium-sized personality crisis was over, I started plotting &#x26; scheming.\nGod damn it, I’m not part of the sheeple, I’m a right-minded guy. </p>\n<p>I can use these algorithms in a way that enhances my life. If I’m going to binge, I want to binge content that gives me energy. If I’m going to fall down one of those infamous Youtube rabbit-holes, I want to come out of it inspired; having learned something. </p>\n<h3>Let me elaborate on my plan.</h3>\n<p>You undoubtedly know the feeling: you snap out of a boredom-induced scrolling sesh thinking: “what the hell did I just spend 20 minutes of my life on?” </p>\n<p>Social media platforms understand our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-N2icd1cE8\">lizard</a> brains, our primary reactions and emotions to all things colorful, shiny and potentially interesting. They understand what keeps us engaged better than we do ourselves. </p>\n<p>This is why you may find yourself watching a staggering 7 minutes worth of bridesmaid-catches-bouqet Instagram reels, while you are not particularly interested that subject (…right?).\nAgain, not an expert; just spitballing here - you can <a href=\"www.trustcharliedickens.com\">trust me</a> though. </p>\n<p>Now I don’t know about you, but I hate zoning out like that. I don’t enjoy feeling like my autonomy is being stolen. </p>\n<h3>So what’s a boy to do<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyOOYn3A_6I\">?</a></h3>\n<p>How can you win a fight against a system that is smarter more powerful than you? Maybe someday I’ll give it a try, but I just don’t feel like deleting everything right now. </p>\n<p>  This is where my 7-step plan comes in. Don’t worry, it’s tried-and-true, totally scientifically substantiated and <em>definitely effective</em>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t stop consuming content</li>\n<li>Do start watching content <em>intentionally</em>:</li>\n<li>Write down a list of things that give you energy and enhance your life (for me: cooking, running, art, music)</li>\n<li>Follow accounts related to these subjects</li>\n<li>Binge content related to these subjects</li>\n<li>Repeat until the algorithm understands that you have changed your ways</li>\n<li>Take pride in the fact that you, my friend, are not part of the sheeple</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Now did they throw that bouquet yet?</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"On gaming the system: a 7-step plan towards algorithm autonomy","date":"February 15, 2021","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/on-gaming-the-system/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/on-language-and-linkedin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On language and LinkedIn titles"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-real-name-changer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On Charlie Dickens: a true name changer"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
