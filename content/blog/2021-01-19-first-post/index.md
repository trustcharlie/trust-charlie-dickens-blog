Few things are as satisfying as successfully revisiting an album. The reason why you haven’t been listening to it don’t actually matter. Maybe you enjoyed the album in the past, maybe you didn’t. Or maybe the first listen didn’t even make an impression on you at all. Maybe you sorta kinda heard about it, sorta kinda listened to it and then sorta kinda forgot about it again. Music isn't always love at first sight. That’s fine. Today I want to talk about the magic that is revisiting (or sometimes rediscovering) of an album. 

I find it funny to think about the way my perception of music is ever-changing. I have gone through countless different phases. I assume many music listeners will recognize that. These different phases of listening are not linear and not logical. They are ambiguous, overlapping and sometimes outright contradictory. For instance, I would say that in the latter half of 2020, my music consumption has been dominated by a return to heavy, guitar based music. Think poetic-yet-in-your-face hardcore from [Drug Church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8edYyKxEVZs), guilty-pleasure-goth from Bauhaus and Type O Negative and straight-up-doomer-shoegaze from Have A Nice Life. However, in that same period I found myself unapologetically vibing to the careless, steeped-in-mezcal sounds of Mapache as well as HAIMs energetic new release. Oh, and at that same time, I was investing my ears into the sublime techno curation and DJ skills of DVS1, Oscar Mulero and Jeff Mills. 

My point is: sometimes, an album may be perfect for your next musical phase, you just haven’t arrived there yet. And the delayed gratification of revisiting that same album when the time is right for it, can make you fall in love with music even harder. So what triggers me to go back to an album? It could be anything really, but I like to think of it in terms of external and internal triggers.
